TOTIBOT

Humans are less and less inclined to be bored because of the busy contemporary lifestyle. Free time, identified as the time one is not working, is overladen with activities and boredom is often perceived as negative.
Nevertheless these moments are necessary for the brain which will switch to the so-called Default Mode Network when one is not focusing on a task, which is a kind of reboot.

The aim of this project is to bring out these moments. The programm would collect datas while the user is active and restart 
when they are not. Nevertheless the user can keep it running while not active if they are interacting with it.
