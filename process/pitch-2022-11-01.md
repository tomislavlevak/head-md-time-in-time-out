Outside of Time

Humans are less and less inclined to be bored because of the busy contemporary lifestyle.  
Free time, identified as the time one is not working, is overladen with activities and boredom is often perceived as negative.
Some observations show that people might experience anxiety while having nothing to do.
The aim of this project is to allow the user to reboot their system during these moments by focusing on themself.
