TOTIDOT

Humans are less and less inclined to be bored because of their busy contemporary lifestyle. 
Inactivity is yet an important moment for the brain. It switches to the so-called Default Mode Network if one is not focusing on a task. This mode is a kind of reboot for the brain.

TOTIDOT uses body datas to generate a visual that let the user track their level of activity through the day. If the user enters a reboot mode so will TOTIDOT. If the user doesn't stop neither will TOTIDOT.

Time for a break or should we see how far we can push the game?
